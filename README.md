# Baking App

This app gets the information about recipes in one Json file, througt in Retrofit call.
Provindin a list of recipes. 

The list of ingredients and yours the steps, with videos, are shown in the second screen.

Futhermore, was used to Master Detail Flow to make the app more resposive in big screens.
## Features

With the app, I learned:
* Use MediaPlayer / Exoplayer to show videos
* Dealing with error cases on Android
* Add a widget to the app experience
* Leverage a third-party library in your application
* Use Fragments to create responsive design that works on phones and tablets
